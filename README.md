# Google_Crash_Course_Python

This is a course notes for a "Coursera: Crash Course on Python" including all exercises in the modules plus additional exercise and my own addings. All new topics devided by sections and every exercise has description and coding been checked. If you'll find any bag please let me know. Please note that modules exams not included due to the google regulations. I would be happy if following notes will be useful in your python study. 
Good luck!
